### What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
#### Crime in Oahu, Hawaii. 
### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?
#### Crime and criminal activity is a fascinating world that lies beneath the surface of daily life. I would like to shed some light on the shadow side of life. 
### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
#### The goal is to discover trends and make predictions:
#### Where are the crime hotspots, are particular locations associated with specific crimes?
#### Are there trends in time that specific crimes take place?
#### Where and when will the next crime occur?
#### What is the frequency of specific crimes?
### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?
#### HPD Crime Incidents
#### Maintained by the City and County of Honolulu
#### Retrieved from: https://data.honolulu.gov/dataset/HPD-Crime-Incidents/f5dd-pqys
#### This dataset was last updated 9/17/22
#### Shape: 23k rows, 10 columns 
#### Dataset is connected to CrimeMapping.com, which visually plots out the crime points on a map
#### CrimeMapping is literally a dashboard, which takes care of EDA
#### Thus, my focus will be on building a predictive model
### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?
#### Type of crime 
#### Thousands of incidents 
#### Countys/locations/cities within Hawaii 
### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?
#### Number of occurances and frequency over time per crime type
### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?
#### No NLP
#### possibly clustering
### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?
#### Will do a train split of the data, possibly 80%/20% split
### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?
#### To better understand the nature, frequency, and timing of specific crimes in Oahu, Hawaii.
